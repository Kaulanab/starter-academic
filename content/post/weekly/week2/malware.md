 **What is Malware?**

Malware is an umbrella term for any form of “MAlicious softWARE” that acts against the interest of a legitimate computer user. It is any type of software designed with criminal or malicious intent. Malicious intent varies from the theft of data, disruption of online services, use of computer resources without permission, surveillance, damages to data storage, and obstruction of legitimate access to data.

The term malware is often used interchangeably with the word virus, however, meanings differ. Malware encompasses any form of malicious software including viruses, while a virus is a type of malware with self-replicating capabilities. Therefore all kinds of a virus are malware, but not all kinds of malware is a virus.
Other kinds of malware include spyware, adware, Trojan horses, worms, rootkits, ransomware, and botnet..

Virus: for a piece of malicious software to be categorized as a virus, it must possess the unique ability to replicate itself across multiple devices. This means that this software will distribute copies of itself using different means to infect as many devices as possible. A computer virus acts exactly like its cousin the biological virus, infecting as many devices as it can access.

Spyware: A spyware is a kind of software used to conduct surveillance on a person, this software gathers your information and exfiltrate it to an attacker somewhere else. Spyware ranges from trackers that monitor your internet activity to sophisticated espionage tools used to track and monitor a person’s location and communications.

Adware: An adware is used by its creator to show a victim unwanted adverts and to profiteer from such by earning money for each ad shown. Although adware does not necessarily cause damages to devices, ads shown are naturally intrusive and they consume part of the device’s resources therefore preventing legitimate software and applications from functioning adequately.
Certain kinds of adware also steal data from infected devices to tailor specific ads to the victim.

Trojan Horses: A trojan is a kind of malicious software that tries to imitate or mimic legitimate software to infect a device. A trojan is generally designed to infect and inflict some harmful damage to your data, device, or network by masquerading as legitimate software or application.

Worms: A computer worm is similar to the virus in basic characteristics as it also possesses the ability to self replicate itself across multiple hosts. However, while a computer virus requires a user’s interaction to activate itself and move around. A worm can replicate and transfer itself across devices without any user interaction. A good example of a worm is Stuxnet developed Possibly by the US and Israeli intelligence forces to attack Iran’s nuclear reactors

Rootkits: A rootkit is a kind of malware used to gain remote access and control of your device. Installing a rootkit gives the attacker full administrative privileges of the victim’s device to make any kind of changes in the system configuration and settings.

Ransomware: ransomware is one of the most damaging kinds of malware in existence. This kind of malware works just like the name implies, locking up data and making it inaccessible while trying to extort a ransom from the victim to retrieve such data. Ransomware operators frequently breach corporate networks and encrypt multiple servers to disrupt normal business activities, forcing such a company to pay such ransom to minimize loss of profit to the business.

Bots: A bot is a kind of software that perform repetitive actions on command. Bot technology is used by malicious attackers to enslave devices online to do their bidding. A collection of devices infected and enslaved by a botmaster is known as a botnet. Botnets are used to launch denial of service attacks by malicious attackers.

How does a device get infected by malware?

One of the oldest mediums for malware infection is through emails or in particular spam mails.
An attacker may send out a couple of thousand spam emails laced with malware in the hope that a few recipients click such mails, leading to the infection of that device by malware. Targeted attacks also utilize emails to deliver malware to a recipient, using various social engineering techniques to increase the chances of infection.
Other modes of infection include passing infected USB drives around, directing a victim to a hacked or malicious website which automatically downloads malware once a victim visits the website, this kind of attack is also known as a watering hole attack.
Downloading software from unverified sources can also lead to malware infections as attackers often lace legitimate software clones with malware on different software stores.

Malware protection: safeguarding your data

Protecting your device from malware infection is a continuous and never-ending process. Downloading reliable antivirus software on all your devices for your protection is a step in the right direction. Regularly update your devices for the latest security updates, Avoid opening suspicious emails on your devices, do no insert random USB drives into your PC, and also avoid clicking suspicious web links if you are not sure about the origin of such link.
