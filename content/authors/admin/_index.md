Hi, My name is Daniel Ola-Olorun and I am a Cloud DevOps Engineer currently living and working remotely from Lagos, Nigeria.

I have always been fascinated by technology and its ability to solve complex problems. This passion led me to pursue a career in Cloud and Security. 

As a Cloud DevOps Engineer, my work involves designing, implementing, and maintaining cloud infrastructure to support software applications. I am particularly interested in the automation aspect of DevOps, as I believe that it can help teams to work more efficiently and effectively. I have experience working with AWS and Azure and I am always eager to learn new cloud technologies.

In addition to my work in Cloud DevOps, I am also interested in cybersecurity. With the increasing prevalence of cyber attacks, I believe that it is essential for all technology professionals to have a solid understanding of cybersecurity principles. I am constantly learning about the latest threats and best practices to protect against them.

When I am not working, I enjoy reading about technology trends and advancements. I also enjoy coding and solving machines on hackthebox.eu and tryhackme.com.

Thank you for taking the time to read my biography. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me.
